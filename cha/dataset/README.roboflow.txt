The dataset includes 424 images.
White_pawn are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -4 and +4 degrees
* Random shear of between -1째 to +1째 horizontally and -1째 to +1째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and +20 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 0.6 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.04 percent of pixels
